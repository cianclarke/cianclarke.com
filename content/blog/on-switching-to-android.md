What a title, huh? Bet you never thought you'd see the day.. But, when a shiny new Galaxy S6 - one of flagship new Android devices. 

My first observation is the out-of-the-box setup. It's abysmal, and not only has the device vendor (Samsung) meddled with the fantastic out-of-the-box defaults that Android provides, but the network vendor (AT&T, Verizon, et al) have then bundled their bloatware on top.  
All this means, when somebody walks into the store and buys a shiny new device, it's already been set up in an impossible-to-use way. A prime example of this is messages. 
Verizon install a messaging app on the phone for messaging, and this is set as the default client. 
On top of this is the samsung messaging app. 
Lastly, Google has their own messaging app, Hangouts (which is _really_ nice). Which am I supposed to use? 
The case is similar for email, and many other sdcenarios. 

Things are also a little less stable. Within the first day of using the phone, the hardware rebooted itself, and a number of apps "Stopped responding".
