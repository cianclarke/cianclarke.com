<small>*__Disclaimer:__ Every effort has been made to anonymise all data published. All queries were run by a third party who provided descriptions of the various AM tables - I do not have access to the data set. I cannot run queries on the database-can't and won't tell you if your partner was a member.*</small>

The Ashley Madison leak provided an interesting insight into the seedy underworld of a cheater. Unlike other dating sites, Ashley Madison's parent company Avid Life Media made no attempt to hide what this was - an outlet for otherwise married or committed individuals to have an affair. 
Without further ado I present the data.   
<small>(In many cases, the charts provide more data by hovering a mouse pointer over the lines. To see more detailed information, see the [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aUjSfZq2PHUIIOlnie2WK8GnXlk4jnX_jiLtdMFl5x4/edit?usp=sharing).)</small>

##By Gender
Ashley Madison provides two options - Male or Female. Not a very modern view of gender identity, but that's probably not the biggest issue here :-)  
> Irish Ashley Madison users were 89% male, 11% female.

##Email Providers of Irish Users
This data set shows the most common domain names (the @something.com part) of all Irish users email addresses. 
> Irish email addresses included names  
>@defenceforces.ie,  @the-sun.ie, **@garda.ie**, @gov.ie, @agriculture.gov.ie, **@revenue.ie** and **many more** besides.

Note the **data** in this graph **is logarithmic** - emails in this chart @gmail.com are not directly comparable to emails @vodafone.ie, check the numeric legend at the top.

<small><small>_Domain names with one or less users have been filtered in an attempt to protect anonymity. There were many small businesses or sole traders which fit into this category.
Another data set of Irish domains is available [here](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1131b64c26180fcbc604), also filtered, which queries the database for emails which end in `.ie`, regardless of country._</small></small>

##Most Popular Turn Ons
The "My Perfect Match" section of the site, this is what Irish users have stated turns them on in a partner, sorted by most popular. Unsurprisingly, Discretion/Secrecy is one of the most attractive traits to Irish Ashley Madison users. 
A total of 293 users also declare their love of routine as a turn on - I'm sure those folk must be a real riot.
