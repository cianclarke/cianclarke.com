I can’t help but feel camera manufacturers have stagnated over the past few years. It’s become a megapixel race, which is of no interest to any self respecting professional photographer. I can still produce magazine quality photos with my 8 year old Canon 20D from 2004 with it’s mere 8.2mp. In fact, besides HD video shooting, which came in 2008, what have camera manufacturers been doing?

Then I came across the Samsung Galaxy camera. Samsung have used Android JellyBean as the operating system of the camera, driving all menus and interactions. At first glance, it seems  like a great idea – combining a powerful touch interface with the ability to write apps specific to a camera.

Android seems a perfect fit for this idea – an API could be introduced to determine if the device is a camera, making camera-specific apps a possibility. Third party developers could undoubtedly develop incredible solutions:

- WiFi syncing all the photos from a shoot as they’re taken – to the web, Dropbox, your PC, wherever!
- Communicate with larger screened Android tablets for photo editing
- Wirelessly communicate with smart TV’s
- Social network photo apps are perfect out of the box – Facebook Camera, Instagram

But wait, what’s this? [Is that a home screen I see?](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17xhbfoswbbjejpg/original.jpg) But of course! There’s the memos app, and there’s your contacts, and there’s the web browser.  
 It turns out, this is just another unfortunate example of Samsung getting it *all wrong*.

What Samsung have done is taken Android OS, and added in a custom camera app, leaving in all the other clutter. Tiny icons sit on a home screen full of apps that don’t belong on a camera. Typically I’m against manufacturers taking Android OS apart, and Samsung are infamous for doing so – but for a camera? Maybe a custom interface wouldn’t be such a bad idea!  
 I can’t help but think how Samsung have taken an exceptional concept, and let it down with such poor software.

This leads me to another thought – what if Apple were to build a camera? Not Apple’s [1994 QuickTake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_QuickTake), no – a new camera, for the “post-PC era”. I can’t help but think they’d do a better job. Sure, it’d be iOS based, but I highly doubt we’d see an iPhone firmware directly ported to the back of a camera. No, it’d be custom – just like Apple TV’s, 100% fit for it’s purpose.  
 It’d ship with PhotoStream, iCloud and AirPlay all integrated. It’d be an exceptional device.

It’d also be *really* expensive – which is why I think it’s a pity Samsung didn’t get this right.
